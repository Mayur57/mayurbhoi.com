          This website utilizes an IP geolocation feature that records and displays the general
          location of the previous visitor to the current visitor. Please note that no personal
          information is collected or stored. The location data displayed is derived solely from the
          IP address of the visitor, which provides non-specific location details such as city and
          country. This is publically available information. The website does not collect or retain
          any additional identifiable information, nor does it store IP addresses beyond their
          location data. All location information is stored temporarily for the purpose of enhancing
          user experience and is not shared with other third parties either.
