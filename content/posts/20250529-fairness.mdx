We tell ourselves a lot of stories to get through the day. Some are harmless—that our morning coffee tastes better than it actually does, that our commute isn't soul-crushing, that our work matters in some cosmic sense. But there's one story we tell ourselves that's not just wrong—it's actively harmful. It's the story that the universe is supposed to be fair.
This might be the biggest lie we've collectively agreed to believe.

## The Myth We've Built

From childhood, we're fed this narrative of cosmic justice. Good things happen to good people. Hard work pays off. Cheaters never prosper. The arc of the moral universe bends toward justice. It's a beautiful story, and it's complete bullshit.
Look around. The hardest working people you know are probably barely scraping by while trust fund kids coast through life on family money. Dictators die peacefully in their beds while activists get disappeared. Companies that poison rivers get tax breaks while teachers buy their own supplies. The universe isn't just indifferent to fairness—it seems to actively mock the concept.

## The Dangerous Comfort of "Deserving"

This fairness myth isn't just wrong—it's a tool of control. When we believe the universe is fair, we start thinking in terms of "deserving." Rich people must deserve their wealth. Poor people must deserve their poverty. Sick people must have done something wrong. Success becomes a moral judgment rather than a statistical outcome.
This thinking is poison. It lets us ignore systemic problems by pretending individual outcomes reflect individual worth. Can't afford healthcare? Should have worked harder. Born into poverty? Should have chosen better parents. It's victim-blaming dressed up as cosmic justice.
The fairness myth serves power. It suggests that existing hierarchies exist for good reasons, that the people at the top earned their place through virtue while those at the bottom earned theirs through vice. It's a convenient story for those who benefit from inequality.

## What We Lose When We Expect Fairness

Expecting fairness doesn't just make us wrong—it makes us weak. When we believe the universe owes us something, we waste energy being outraged when it doesn't deliver. We spend our lives waiting for some cosmic scales to balance instead of taking action ourselves.
I've watched brilliant people destroy themselves with bitterness because life didn't match their expectations of fairness. They raged against the randomness instead of adapting to it. They demanded justice from a universe that doesn't even understand the concept.
Meanwhile, people who accept the universe's indifference often thrive. They don't waste time being angry at reality. They don't wait for someone else to fix things. They understand that if you want fairness in the world, you have to create it yourself.

## The Freedom in Unfairness

Here's what I've learned: accepting that the universe is unfair is liberating. It frees you from the exhausting work of trying to justify every outcome. Bad things happen to good people not because of some cosmic plan or because they secretly deserved it, but because bad things just happen.
This acceptance doesn't make you cynical—it makes you realistic. And realism is the foundation of effective action. When you stop expecting the universe to be fair, you can focus on making it more fair yourself.

## Building Justice in an Unjust Universe

The universe doesn't owe us fairness, but that doesn't mean we can't create it. Every institution that promotes justice—courts, schools, social safety nets—exists because humans decided to impose fairness on an unfair world. We built these systems not because the universe demanded them, but because we demanded them.
This is the real work: not waiting for cosmic justice, but creating human justice. Not demanding that the universe be fair, but making our small corner of it more fair than we found it.
The civil rights movement didn't succeed because the universe finally decided to be fair to Black Americans. It succeeded because people organized, protested, and forced change. Workers didn't get the eight-hour day because the universe decided they deserved it. They got it because they went on strike and demanded it.

## Living Without the Lie

Once you accept that the universe is indifferent, everything changes. You stop wasting energy on outrage and start focusing on outcomes. You stop waiting for someone else to fix things and start fixing them yourself. You stop expecting rewards for good behavior and start doing good because it's good.
This isn't nihilism—it's responsibility. When you realize the universe isn't going to deliver justice, you have to. When you understand that fairness isn't a cosmic principle but a human project, you become part of that project.
The universe doesn't owe you anything. It never did. But that's not a reason for despair—it's a reason to get to work. The fairness we create ourselves is worth more than any fairness we could have been handed.

## The Real Universe

The real universe is stranger and more beautiful than our fairness myths. It's a place where entropy increases and particles decay randomly, where stars explode without regard for the civilizations they might destroy, where evolution proceeds through accident and struggle rather than design and justice.
This universe created conscious beings who invented concepts like fairness and justice and love—concepts that don't exist in physics but matter more than physics to the beings who hold them. We are the universe becoming aware of itself, and part of that awareness is recognizing that fairness is something we must create, not something we can expect.
The biggest lie isn't that the universe is unfair—that's obviously true. The biggest lie is that this unfairness should stop us from building something better. The universe owes us nothing, which means everything we build, we build ourselves. And that makes it ours in a way that cosmic gifts never could be.
Stop waiting for fairness. Start making it.
